# Candidate-Matching
The candidate matching project uses machine Learning to pair candidate with jobs. It involves loading &amp; preprocessing data, combining job attributes, filtering candidate &amp; vectorizing text using TF-IDF. Cosine similarity calculate the match between resumes and job descriptions, identifying the best job for each candidate efficiently and accurately.

# Project involves extensive use of NLP features as in:

- tokenization
- lemmatization 
-	Count Vectorization
-	TF-IDF
